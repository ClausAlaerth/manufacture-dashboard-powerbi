# Manufacture Dashboard with Power BI

This particular dashboard uses an organization's manufacture dataset, with data on all of its employees, the amount of products the developed and in how much time. The creation of this dash involved the use of well known design tips, for a better and more professional background. The raw dataset didn't need to be transformed with Power Query, however, to have access to some otherwise difficult information that Power BI couldn't gather alone, the use of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) was needed.

These expressions varied from simple addition and division between columns, to SUM functions, then going as far as using CALCULATE with conditionals, which really increased my understanding.

As is usual with Power BI, this dashboard is dynamic, changing its values just by focusing on the intended information, the rest of the dash will follow suit, showing only pertinent info the user will require. To add to this, the dashboard counts with some slicers to increase the quality of user interactions and provide better information.
